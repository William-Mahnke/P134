This repository contains my work from PSTAT134: Statistical Data Science. Files in this repo include homework and lab assignments covering a wide variety of topics including image classification and natural language processing. This repo also contains the final notebook and report from my group project, building a recommender system for restaurants in the Isla Vista/Goleta/Santa Barbara area. 

File Descriptions:
* Homework: contains homework assignments with code in both R and Python. Homework assignments three and four required other files to finish. Homework 5 contains work on image classification. Due to the number of images we were working with, it wasn't possible to upload them to the repository.
* Labs: contains lab assignments/tutorials with code in both R and Python
* Data: contains csv files of data used in homework assignments, labs, and the data used for the final project
* report.ipynb: comprehensive file of our work during the group project
